# Guess-The-Number
My first mini project with HTML, CSS, JavaScript and Bootstrap library

The page has been built with Bootstap library in order to be responsive.

The user should fill a number between 1-20 when the status is "Start guessing...".

Then the user should click the "Check" button and a message appears if it is High or Low in compare with the secret number that has been generated from code.
If the user does not provide a number a message appears.

In every wrong guess, the counter of the score decreases by 1

When the user guess the right number the box turns to Green and a message appears

Also, the Highscore takes the value of the score!

In order to play again the user should click the "Reset" button
